Integrating scientific computing and technological advancements into academic and professional workflows has been rapid and profound.
However, educational institutions have been slow to adapt their pedagogical strategies to meet the demands of the digital age, a challenge further emphasized by the rise of generative artificial intelligence.
This situational analysis explores the current state of scientific computing and education in the computational sciences, highlighting the need for reform in educational frameworks and mentorship practices.

## Stagnant educational framework

The rapid evolution of computational sciences has posed significant challenges for undergraduate curricula, which often struggle to keep pace with the field's advancements.
This lag between academic programs and industry demands results in graduates who may lack the necessary skills and knowledge to excel in contemporary research or professional roles.
Recognizing this disparity, there is a growing call for more adaptable, responsive, and agile curricula that effectively incorporate new developments and best practices.

The integration of scientific computing has profoundly transformed various disciplines, revolutionizing research and problem-solving approaches.
This transformation has created a new set of essential skills for students and professionals, including computational literacy, data proficiency, and the ability to collaborate effectively in interdisciplinary teams.
However, traditional educational models have often failed to adapt to these evolving demands, with curriculum structures, teaching methodologies, and assessment strategies remaining rooted in approaches from the pre-digital era.
These outdated practices may not sufficiently address the complex, data-intensive, and rapidly changing nature of computational sciences.

Consequently, educational institutions face a pressing need to reimagine and redesign their curricula to align with the current and future requirements of the field.
This process involves a comprehensive reassessment of program structures, course content, and teaching methods to ensure they effectively prepare students for the challenges and opportunities they will encounter in their careers.
By embracing a more flexible, interdisciplinary, and industry-informed approach to curriculum development, universities can bridge the gap between academia and the professional world, equipping graduates with the tools they need to succeed in the dynamic landscape of computational sciences.

## Exclusive classroom learning is insufficient

Undergraduate education in computational sciences has evolved beyond the traditional classroom setting, necessitating a more comprehensive approach to mentorship and skill development.
While faculty members have been instrumental in guiding undergraduates, relying solely on these individuals to shoulder the responsibility of mentoring students places an undue burden on them.
Particularly given the limited number of computational researchers, resources, and bandwidth.

Internships have emerged as a valuable avenue for students to gain practical experience and exposure to industry practices. However, the highly competitive nature of these opportunities often leaves many talented students without access to such experiences.
To address this issue, educational institutions must foster strong working relationships with industry partners.
By establishing a robust pipeline between academia and industry, universities can create more accessible and diverse internship opportunities for their students, ensuring a more equitable distribution of valuable hands-on learning experiences.

Undergraduate research is another essential component of a well-rounded education in computational sciences.
Engaging in research projects allows students to apply their knowledge, develop critical thinking skills, and contribute to advancing their field.
However, the current economic landscape poses challenges for students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, as they may not have the financial means to dedicate time to research for academic credit.
While faculty members play a vital role in mentoring undergraduate researchers, it is essential to recognize the limitations of relying solely on their resources and time.


## Paradox of technological surface learning


The rapid integration of technology into our daily lives has given rise to a generation of students who have grown up in a digitally saturated environment.
However, this familiarity with consumer technology interfaces, such as smartphones and applications, often masks a lack of deeper technical literacy.
While students may be adept at navigating user-friendly interfaces, they may struggle with understanding the underlying mechanisms of computing and the foundational principles of scientific computing.

The ease of use and accessibility of modern technology has fostered a consumerist approach to digital tools.
Understanding the inner workings of technology is no longer necessary to use it.
This shift towards simplified user experiences has democratized access to technology.
Still, it has also contributed to a growing chasm between users and the skills required to create, innovate, and comprehend the deeper layers of technology.
As a result, students may be ill-equipped to contribute to scientific computing, software development, and the broader technological innovation landscape.

The consequences of this technological surface learning are not limited to individual students; they also highlight the stagnant nature of educational models in the face of rapid technological integration.
There is a growing recognition of the skills gap between the competencies developed through traditional education and those required in the modern workplace.
This disparity underscores the urgent need for educational reform that embraces project-based learning, interdisciplinary coursework, and experiential learning opportunities.
By aligning educational practices with the collaborative and problem-solving nature of today's scientific and technological challenges, institutions can better prepare students for the demands of the digital age.

## Need for Additional Educational and Mentorship Support

As technology advances at an unprecedented rate, it is crucial to recognize that traditional mentorship models, which often rely on one-on-one interactions between a mentor and mentee, may need to be revised to fully support learners in navigating the complexities of the modern world.
In an era of rapid technological change, learners require mentorship beyond acquiring specific skills or knowledge.
They need guidance in developing the adaptability and resilience necessary to thrive in a constantly shifting landscape.
While valuable in their own right, traditional mentorship approaches may not be equipped to address the multifaceted nature of learning in this context.

The digital age has brought about a paradigm shift in how we access, process, and apply information.
Learners are now exposed to a vast array of resources and opportunities for growth, but this abundance can also be overwhelming and challenging to navigate.
Mentorship practices must evolve to help learners make sense of this information-rich environment and develop the critical thinking skills necessary to discern valuable insights from noise.

Moreover, the rapid pace of technological change has blurred the lines between disciplines and industries.
Learners must be prepared to work across multiple domains and collaborate with diverse teams.
Traditional mentorship models, which often focus on a single area of expertise, may not adequately prepare learners for the interdisciplinary nature of modern work.

Another aspect of this issue is the changing demographics of learners in higher education.
As more non-traditional students, such as working professionals and adult learners, seek educational opportunities, mentorship practices must adapt to accommodate their unique needs and experiences.
These learners often bring valuable real-world perspectives to the learning environment but may also face additional challenges in balancing their educational pursuits with other responsibilities.
