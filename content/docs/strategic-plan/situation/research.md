The rapid advancement of computational sciences has revolutionized modern research, enabling scientists to tackle complex problems and generate groundbreaking insights across various disciplines.
However, the current landscape of computational biology in academic institutions faces several challenges that hinder the effective utilization of these powerful tools.
This situational analysis delves into four key areas of concern.
By examining these challenges, we aim to identify opportunities for enhancing the integration of computational biology within our institution and fostering a more collaborative, efficient, and impactful research environment.

## Fragmentation across departments

Many disciplines leverage the power of computing to tackle complex problems and generate new insights across a wide range of fields including physics, chemistry, biology, and engineering.
However, the current organizational structure of many universities often results in computational expertise being scattered across different departments&mdash;each with its own resources, expertise, and focus.

This fragmentation can make it challenging for students and researchers to navigate the available resources effectively.
Students need help identifying the most relevant labs for their research interests or be unaware of the full range of computational tools and expertise available within the institution.
This lack of visibility and accessibility can limit the potential for interdisciplinary collaboration and hinder the development of innovative research projects.

Moreover, the fragmentation of computational sciences labs can lead to duplication of efforts and inefficiencies in resource allocation.
Each department may invest in similar computational infrastructure and software, leading to redundancies and increased costs.
This fragmentation can also make it difficult to share best practices and knowledge across labs, as each operates within its departmental silo.

This fragmentation issue is more problematic in the context of interdisciplinary research.
Many of the most pressing scientific challenges of our time, such as understanding complex biological systems or addressing climate change, require integrating knowledge and techniques from multiple disciplines.
However, when computational sciences labs are isolated within their respective departments, fostering the necessary collaborations and knowledge exchange to tackle these complex problems effectively can be challenging.

## Research mentorship

Research training has relied heavily on a singular mentor-mentee relationship.
This model does have its merits; having a primary mentor dedicated to their specific research area provides the necessary depth of knowledge and technical expertise.
However, it may not address the nature of contemporary research and the broader professional skills necessary for success beyond academia&mdash;especially computational sciences.

A thesis committee system is intended to provide graduate students with a diverse range of expertise and guidance.
However, the reality is that committee members often have numerous competing time commitments which limit their ability to offer comprehensive and consistent mentorship.
As a result, students may find that their interactions with committee members are limited to formal meetings and milestone events, such as proposal defenses and annual progress reviews.
While these interactions are valuable, they may not provide the ongoing, in-depth guidance and feedback that students need.

## Demand for Computational Expertise

In recent years, the volume and complexity of data generated by experimental labs have grown exponentially.
Technological advances, such as high-throughput sequencing, high-resolution imaging, and sensor networks, have enabled researchers to collect vast amounts of data at unprecedented scales and levels of detail.
While this data holds immense potential for scientific discovery, it also presents significant challenges for analysis and interpretation.
Experimental labs require expertise in computational sciences to fully harness the power of this data, such as programming, data management, statistical analysis, and machine learning.

Even when experimental labs recognize the need for computational expertise, they may need help accessing technical resources and support.
High-performance computing infrastructure, specialized software tools, and data management systems can be costly and complex to set up and maintain.
Experimental researchers may struggle to navigate these technical challenges and effectively integrate computational methods into their research workflows without proper guidance and support.

Lack of experimental expertise in computational sciences can also limit the ability to collaborate.
Interdisciplinary collaboration is increasingly essential for tackling complex scientific problems and driving innovation.
However, experimental and computational researchers may struggle to work together effectively without a shared understanding of computational methods and a common language for communication.

## Open Source and Reproducible Practices

The reproducibility crisis in computational sciences stems from the growing recognition that many published research findings are difficult or impossible to replicate.
This crisis undermines scientific results' credibility and reliability, slowing the pace of discovery and innovation.
Several factors contribute to this gap between recognizing the importance of reproducibility and implementing best practices.

One key factor is the rapid pace of research progress in computational sciences.
As new methods, tools, and technologies accelerate, researchers may struggle to keep up with the latest standards and best practices for ensuring reproducibility.
This can lead to researchers using outdated or inconsistent practices, making it difficult for others to reproduce their work.

Implementing best practices for reproducibility often requires significant time and effort.
Researchers may need to carefully document their data, code, and analysis workflows and make them available in a transparent and accessible format.
This can be daunting, especially for complex and large-scale computational projects.
Without proper incentives and support from institutions and funding agencies, researchers may prioritize other aspects of their work over reproducibility.
