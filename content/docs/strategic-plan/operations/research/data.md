SC2 will generate and curate foundational datasets and provide a FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data repository to enable secure and accessible sharing of research data. Key elements include:

1. Generating high-quality, well-documented datasets for computational experiments. Establishing partnerships to expand available data.

2. Curating simulation benchmarks to assess performance of models across disciplines. Providing guidelines on running benchmarks and interpreting results. Updating benchmarks to reflect advances.

3. Developing quantum chemistry method libraries with user-friendly interfaces. Curating molecular datasets for validation. Offering training on principles and tools.

4. Building optimized algorithm repositories with performance analysis services. Providing development guidelines and hosting solution challenges.

5. Assigning persistent identifiers and rich metadata to datasets. Indexing in search engines for discoverability. 

6. Providing user-friendly, secure data access interfaces with authentication. Ensuring long-term accessibility through stable formats and storage.

7. Adopting standards for data/metadata interoperability. Providing APIs for data access and integration.

8. Applying clear data usage licenses. Offering comprehensive dataset documentation. Supporting data quality and reproducibility.

9. Engaging the research community for feedback. Making updates to enhance utility and FAIR compliance.
