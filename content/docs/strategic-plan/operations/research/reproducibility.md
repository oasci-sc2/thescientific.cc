SC2 will communicate reproducibility standards and provide training and resources to enhance the quality and impact of research. Key activities include:

1. Clarifying aspects of reproducibility (repeatability, replicability, robustness) and establishing clear guidelines for research projects.

2. Offering workshops, online resources, and tutorials on reproducibility principles, study design, data management, and computational tools. Partnering with Software Carpentry for hands-on workshops.

3. Encouraging use of version control (e.g. Git), open access repositories, and reproducible research platforms (e.g. Jupyter, R Markdown).  

4. Establishing certification and recognition for research meeting high reproducibility standards.

5. Continuously evaluating and improving training and support based on feedback and emerging best practices.
