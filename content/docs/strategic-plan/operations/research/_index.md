   The Scientific Computing Core serves as a central pillar supporting the university's scientific computing.
   This section outlines the operational strategies that SC2 will employ to provide research consultation and support to faculty members.
   Our focus is on delivering a range of services with the goal of enhancing research outcomes while establishing a model for financial sustainability.  

   Our operations are built on three key principles:

   - Adaptability, to respond to the evolving needs of our research community;
   - Efficiency, to maximize resources and deliver timely support;
   - Sustainability, to ensure our services can be maintained and expanded over time.

   By integrating these principles into our operational framework, SC2 aims to empower faculty members to achieve their research objectives with state-of-the-art computational tools and expert guidance.
   By focusing on these operational areas, SC2 will provide high-value services that meet the evolving needs of the research community, maintain reliable and secure computational resources, and foster an engaged and collaborative scientific community that produces high-quality, reproducible research with strong real-world impact.
