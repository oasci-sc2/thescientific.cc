The Scientific Computing Core serves as a central pillar supporting the university's scientific computing.
This section of our strategic plan outlines the operational strategies that SC2 will employ to provide research consultation and support to faculty members.
Our focus is on delivering a range of services with the goal of enhancing research outcomes while establishing a model for financial sustainability.  

Our operations are built on three key principles:

- Adaptability, to respond to the evolving needs of our research community;
- Efficiency, to maximize resources and deliver timely support;
- Sustainability, to ensure our services can be maintained and expanded over time.

By integrating these principles into our operational framework, SC2 aims to empower faculty members to achieve their research objectives with state-of-the-art computational tools and expert guidance.
