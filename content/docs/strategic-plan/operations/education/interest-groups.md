## Nurturing student-led interest groups

By supporting the formation and growth of interest groups, particularly those focused on computational sciences, we aim to foster a strong sense of community, encourage peer-to-peer learning, and provide opportunities for students to explore their passions beyond the classroom.

### Empowering Student Leadership

To encourage the development of student-led interest groups, we will actively identify and support students who demonstrate a strong passion for computational sciences and possess leadership potential.
Faculty members will play a key role in recognizing and connecting these students with the resources and guidance they need to establish and grow their groups.
This support may include:

- Providing advice on drafting mission statements and setting achievable goals.
- Assisting with the formal registration process for student organizations.
- Connecting student leaders with faculty advisors who can offer ongoing mentorship and support.

In addition to this individualized support, we will also offer leadership training and workshops to help student leaders develop the skills necessary to manage their organizations effectively, plan events, and engage their members.

### Providing Resources and Infrastructure

To ensure that student-led groups have the resources they need to thrive, we will provide a range of support services and infrastructure, including:

- Access to meeting spaces and event venues.
- Assistance with promotional materials and marketing efforts.
- Initial funding for group activities and projects.
- Access to computational resources, software tools, and databases.
- Subscriptions to relevant academic journals and online learning platforms.

We will also work with student leaders to establish effective communication platforms, such as mailing lists, social media groups, and collaboration tools, to facilitate discussions and collaboration among group members.
By providing these resources and infrastructure, we aim to create an environment where student-led groups can flourish and make meaningful contributions to scientific computing.

### Facilitating Engaging Activities and Events

To help student-led groups create vibrant and engaging experiences for their members, we will provide support and guidance in organizing a variety of activities and events, such as:

- Talks and workshops featuring industry professionals, faculty members, and advanced students.
- Hackathons and coding competitions that challenge students to apply their skills to real-world problems.
- Project showcases that allow students to share their work and receive feedback from peers and experts.
- Social events and networking opportunities that connect students with alums, industry professionals, and researchers.

By facilitating these activities and events, we aim to create a rich and dynamic learning environment that extends beyond the classroom and allows students to explore their interests, develop new skills, and build meaningful connections within the computational science community.

### Ensuring Long-term Sustainability

To ensure the long-term success and sustainability of student-led interest groups, we will implement a range of strategies, including:

- Establishing a succession planning process to ensure continuity of leadership as students graduate or move on
- Recognizing and celebrating the achievements and contributions of student groups through awards, featured stories, and official communications
- Continuously evaluating the needs and interests of students and adjusting support and resources accordingly

By investing in the long-term sustainability of student-led groups, we aim to create a lasting culture of engagement, innovation, and community within the computational science program.

Through this comprehensive approach to nurturing student-led interest groups, University of Pittsburgh is committed to empowering students to take ownership of their learning, pursue their passions, and build a strong and supportive community of computational science enthusiasts.
