We recognize the value of established, industry-recognized certifications in the field of computational sciences.
Rather than creating our own certification programs from scratch, we will focus on providing resources, support, and incentives for our students and researchers to pursue these widely-accepted credentials.
Additionally, we will implement a complementary system of skill badges to showcase the specific competencies and achievements of our community members.

### Promoting Established Certifications

We will actively promote and support the pursuit of established certifications in computational sciences, such as:

-   Cloud Computing
-   Data Science
-   Bioinformatics (CBT)
-   Cheminformatics (CCP)
-   Scientific Computing (CSCP)

To facilitate the attainment of these certifications, we will:

1. *Provide Information and Guidance*: We will maintain a comprehensive database of relevant certifications, including details on requirements, exam formats, and recommended preparation resources. Our advisors will offer personalized guidance to help individuals select the certifications that best align with their career goals and interests.
2. *Offer Preparatory Workshops and Study Groups*: We will organize workshops and study groups led by faculty members or certified professionals to help candidates prepare for certification exams. These sessions will focus on reviewing critical concepts, practicing problem-solving skills, and providing tips for effective exam preparation.
3. *Secure Funding for Exam Fees*: We will work to establish scholarships, grants, or reimbursement programs to help cover the costs of certification exams for our students and researchers. By reducing the financial barriers, we aim to make these certifications more accessible to all community members.
4. *Celebrate and Recognize Achievements*: As our community members earn these prestigious certifications, we will celebrate their achievements through public acknowledgments, newsletter features, and showcases on our institutional website. This recognition not only validates their hard work but also inspires others to pursue similar accomplishments.

### Implementing a Skill Badge System

To complement the established certifications, we will create an institution-specific skill badge system that highlights the unique competencies and achievements of our students and researchers in computational sciences. These badges will serve as digital micro-credentials, providing a more granular view of an individual's expertise and contributions.

Our skill badge system will encompass a wide range of computational science competencies, such as:

- Proficiency in specific programming languages (e.g., Python, R, MATLAB)
- Expertise in particular software tools or platforms (e.g., Mathematica, SAS, NVIDIA)
- Completion of specialized courses or workshops
- Participation in research projects or internships
- Contributions to open-source software or community initiatives

To implement this system, we will:

1. *Define Badge Criteria*: We will establish clear, measurable criteria for earning each skill badge. These criteria will be developed with faculty members, industry partners, and computational science experts to ensure their relevance and value.
2. *Create a Digital Badging Platform*: We will invest in a user-friendly digital badging platform that allows individuals to earn, display, and share their badges. This platform will integrate with our existing learning management systems and professional development resources.
3. *Integrate with Academic Programs and Research Projects*: We will work with faculty members to identify opportunities for students and researchers to earn skill badges through their coursework, research projects, and extracurricular activities. This integration will help to embed the badge system into the fabric of our academic programs.
4. *Promote the Value of Skill Badges*: We will actively communicate the value of our skill badges to potential employers, industry partners, and academic collaborators. By demonstrating how these badges represent meaningful, validated competencies, we will enhance the employability and professional reputation of our badge earners.

### Continuous Evaluation and Improvement

To ensure the ongoing relevance and impact of our certification support and skill badge system, we will:

1. *Seek Feedback and Assess Outcomes*: We will regularly solicit feedback from our students, researchers, and industry partners on the effectiveness and value of our initiatives. We will also track the career outcomes and professional achievements of individuals who have earned certifications or badges to assess the tangible impact of these credentials.
2. *Adapt to Evolving Industry Needs*: We will stay attuned to the changing landscape of computational sciences, regularly reviewing and updating the certifications and skills we support to align with emerging technologies, methodologies, and workforce demands.
3. *Collaborate with Industry and Academic Partners*: We will foster strong relationships with industry leaders, professional associations, and other academic institutions to share best practices, identify new opportunities for collaboration, and ensure that our initiatives remain at the forefront of computational science education and workforce development.

By supporting the attainment of established certifications and implementing a complementary skill badge system, University of Pittsburgh aims to empower our students and researchers with the validated, industry-recognized credentials they need to succeed in the rapidly evolving field of computational sciences. Through our commitment to providing resources, recognition, and continuous improvement, we will establish ourselves as a leader in preparing the next generation of computational science professionals.
