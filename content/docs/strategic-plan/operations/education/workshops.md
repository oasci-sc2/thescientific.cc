This investment in our instructors will ensure that our workshops remain engaging, effective, and aligned with best practices in adult learning.

## Interactive and Differentiated Learning Experience

Our workshops will be designed to provide a hands-on, immersive learning experience that caters to participants with varying levels of computational expertise. We recognize that our research community comprises individuals with diverse backgrounds and skill levels, and we are committed to creating an inclusive learning environment that supports the growth and development of all participants. Key features of our workshop execution include:

### Interactive Sessions

We believe that the most effective way to learn computational skills is through practical application. Therefore, our workshops will emphasize interactive sessions where participants work directly with the tools and techniques being taught, using real-world datasets and problems relevant to their research areas. This hands-on approach will facilitate deep learning, as participants actively engage with the material and develop muscle memory for the skills they are acquiring. By working on projects that closely mirror their own research challenges, participants will gain confidence in applying their newly acquired skills to their work.

To support this interactive learning experience, we will provide ample time for guided practice, Q&A sessions, and collaborative problem-solving. Our instructors will be readily available to offer personalized guidance and troubleshoot any issues that arise during the hands-on sessions. We will also foster a supportive peer-learning environment, encouraging participants to share their experiences, insights, and solutions with one another.

### Skill Level Differentiation

We acknowledge that our participants will come to our workshops with varying levels of computational expertise. To ensure that each participant receives a challenging and rewarding learning experience, we will offer differentiated content tailored to specific skill levels. This may include separate tracks or sessions for beginners, intermediate, and advanced users, allowing participants to engage with material that is appropriate for their current abilities and learning goals.

For novice participants, we will provide foundational sessions that cover basic computational concepts, terminology, and tools. These sessions will be designed to build confidence and provide a solid groundwork for future learning. Intermediate and advanced users will have access to more specialized topics and in-depth explorations of cutting-edge techniques. By providing differentiated content, we will ensure that all participants can progress at their own pace and maximize their learning outcomes.

### Infrastructure and Resources

To support the interactive and hands-on nature of our workshops, we will provide participants with access to the necessary computational infrastructure and software. This includes secure, cloud-based environments that are pre-configured with the required tools and datasets, allowing participants to focus on learning and experimentation without the burden of complex setup processes.

In addition to the computational infrastructure, we will develop comprehensive workshop materials, including detailed guides, code repositories, and curated datasets. These resources will be made easily accessible to participants both during and after the workshops, enabling them to revisit the material, continue their practice, and adapt the techniques to their own research projects. By providing ongoing access to these resources, we aim to support the long-term adoption and integration of computational skills into our participants' research workflows.

Furthermore, we will create a dedicated online platform for workshop participants to connect, collaborate, and share their experiences beyond the workshop sessions. This platform will serve as a hub for ongoing support, featuring forums for Q&A, showcases of participant projects, and announcements of future learning opportunities. By fostering a sense of community and continuity, we will encourage participants to continue their computational learning journey and apply their skills to drive innovation in their research.

## Ongoing Support and Community Building

We recognize that learning is an ongoing process that extends beyond the confines of a single workshop. To support our participants' continued growth and development, we are committed to providing ongoing support and fostering a collaborative learning community. Our post-workshop initiatives are designed to reinforce the skills acquired during the workshops, facilitate knowledge sharing, and build a strong network of computational researchers across our university. These initiatives include:

### Follow-Up Resources

To help participants consolidate their learning and expand their knowledge, we will provide a comprehensive suite of follow-up resources. These will include digital copies of workshop materials, such as presentation slides, code examples, and datasets, allowing participants to revisit the content at their own pace and adapt it to their specific research needs. Additionally, we will curate a collection of supplementary reading materials, including research papers, tutorials, and online courses, to help participants deepen their understanding of the topics covered in the workshops.

Recognizing that some participants may benefit from reviewing the workshop content multiple times, we will offer access to recorded sessions whenever possible. These recordings will be made available through a secure online platform, along with timestamps and annotations to facilitate easy navigation and reference. By providing these follow-up resources, we aim to support participants' ongoing learning and help them integrate computational skills into their research workflows.

### Community Building

Building a strong, collaborative learning community is essential to the long-term success of our computational training initiatives. To facilitate ongoing knowledge sharing and peer support, we will create dedicated online forums or discussion groups where workshop participants can engage with one another and with the broader computational research community at our university.

These forums will serve as a platform for participants to ask questions, share insights, and collaborate on problems that arise as they apply their newly acquired skills to their research projects. By encouraging participants to share their experiences, successes, and challenges, we aim to foster a vibrant, supportive learning environment that extends beyond the workshops themselves.

To further strengthen our learning community, we will organize regular meetups, seminars, and hackathons where participants can come together to work on collaborative projects, discuss emerging trends in computational research, and learn from one another. These events will provide opportunities for cross-disciplinary networking, helping to break down silos and spark innovative research collaborations.

### Feedback and Continuous Improvement

To ensure that our workshops remain relevant, effective, and responsive to the evolving needs of our research community, we will implement a robust feedback and continuous improvement process. Immediately following each workshop, we will collect detailed feedback from participants regarding the content, instruction, and overall workshop experience. This feedback will be gathered through a combination of surveys, interviews, and focus group discussions, allowing us to capture both quantitative and qualitative data.
