The Scientific Computing Core (SC2) is committed to advancing the frontiers of computational science with a focus on empowering students at the [University of Pittsburgh](https://www.pitt.edu/) to convert knowledge into tangible, impactful research.
Our mission is to provide a comprehensive framework for learning, applying, and innovating with computational technologies.

SC2 aims to bridge the gap between potential and expertise by creating and sharing cohesive training materials that address various aspects of computational sciences.
We strive to simplify the learning journey, making computational science accessible to research labs across diverse disciplines.
By centralizing education and support, SC2 allows laboratories to focus more on their primary research activities, pushing the boundaries of achievable goals in their fields.

SC2 is committed to providing comprehensive support to ensure that labs produce high-quality, reproducible computational research.
We offer expert advice on best practices in scientific computing, access to state-of-the-art methodologies and infrastructure.
Our goal is to cultivate a supportive atmosphere where every researcher has access to the necessary tools, support, and community to conduct rigorous and impactful computational studies.

Our vision is for SC2 to become a paragon of excellence in computational science education and support, serving as a hub where students and researchers converge to explore, learn, and innovate.
By nurturing a cooperative and inclusive community, we strive to further propel the [University of Pittsburgh](https://www.pitt.edu/) to the forefront of computational science research and education, establishing it as a center for discovery and innovation.
Through our initiatives, we aim to educate and inspire a new generation of scientists equipped with the confidence and creativity to tackle tomorrow's challenges head-on.
