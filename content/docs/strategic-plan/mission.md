The Scientific Computing Core (SC2) is committed to advancing the frontiers of computational science with a focus on empowering students at the University of Pittsburgh to convert knowledge into tangible, impactful research.
Our mission is to provide a comprehensive framework for learning, applying, and innovating with computational technologies, guiding and nurturing the development of the next generation of computational scientists.

SC2 aims to bridge the gap between potential and expertise by creating and sharing cohesive training materials that address various aspects of computational sciences.
We strive to simplify the learning journey, making computational science accessible to research labs across diverse disciplines.
We act as a computational catalyst for research labs, enabling seamless integration of computational science into their investigations without the burden of developing bespoke training programs.
By centralizing education and support, SC2 allows laboratories to focus more on their primary research activities, pushing the boundaries of achievable goals in their fields.

Beyond training, SC2 is dedicated to providing comprehensive support, including advice on best practices, access to state-of-the-art methodologies, and fostering a collaborative environment for idea exchange.
We aim to cultivate a supportive atmosphere where every student has access to the necessary tools, support, and community to thrive in the rapidly evolving landscape of computational science.

Our vision is for SC2 to become a paragon of excellence in computational science education and support, serving as a hub where students and researchers converge to explore, learn, and innovate.
By nurturing a cooperative and inclusive community, we strive to further propel the University of Pittsburgh to the forefront of computational science research and education, establishing it as a center for discovery and innovation.
Through our initiatives, we aim to educate and inspire a new generation of scientists equipped with the confidence and creativity to tackle tomorrow's challenges head-on.
