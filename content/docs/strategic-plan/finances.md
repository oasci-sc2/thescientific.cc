TODO: Describes the financial plan, including the allocation of resources to various parts of the strategic plan.

## Revenue model

### Academic research labs

The follwoing approach articulates a strategic financial framework for SC2, emphasizing cost recovery, financial planning facilitation, and the integration of SC2 services into grant proposals.
By adopting this model, SC2 can align its operational objectives with financial sustainability, ensuring it serves as a vital resource for The #university's research community.

#### Fixed-Price Services

SC2 will implement a fixed-price model for a suite of predefined services.
This model is meticulously designed to cater to standardized computational tasks with well-defined scopes and deliverables.
These services are tailored to meet the fundamental needs of faculty engaged in computational chemistry and biology, ensuring they have access to essential tools and analyses without the complexity of variable pricing.

The fixed-price model is rooted in providing faculty with cost predictability, a critical factor for efficient budgeting and financial planning.
This predictability is especially beneficial when faculty are drafting grant proposals, as it allows for the direct allocation of precise service costs within their budgets.
By offering this level of financial clarity, SC2 facilitates smoother grant application processes and enhances the likelihood of funding approval, as funding bodies prefer well-defined budgets with justified, direct costs.

To establish a viable and competitive fixed-price structure, SC2 will engage in comprehensive cost analysis procedures that encompass both direct and indirect expenses associated with each service.
This analysis will factor in the costs of software licensing, hardware depreciation, maintenance, and the labor hours of personnel involved in service delivery.
Prices will be set at a point that ensures 
SC2 covers its operational costs while providing value to faculty, promoting a sustainable financial model that can support continuous service improvement and expansion.

The pricing strategy will also consider market rates for similar services to ensure competitiveness without compromising quality. Regular reviews of service costs and market conditions will be conducted to adjust pricing as necessary, ensuring SC2 remains a financially viable and attractive option for faculty.

Upon establishing the fixed-price list, SC2 will implement a transparent communication strategy to ensure that faculty are fully informed about available services and their associated costs.
This strategy will include detailed service descriptions, cost breakdowns, and examples of common use cases to aid in service selection.

To maintain financial sustainability and ensure that the fixed-price model continues to meet the needs of the university community, SC2 will monitor service utilization, faculty feedback, and financial performance regularly.
Insights gained from this monitoring will inform potential adjustments to service offerings, pricing, and operational efficiencies, thereby ensuring that SC2 remains a vital and responsive resource for The University of Pittsburgh's research endeavors.

Through this comprehensive approach, the Fixed-Price Services Framework aims not only to simplify the financial aspects of engaging with SC2 but also to foster a supportive environment where faculty can readily access the computational resources they need to advance their research.
